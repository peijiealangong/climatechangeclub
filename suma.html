One of our members recently visited Japan. When she visited Suma Beach, she experienced a surprising sight. She saw a fish made completely out of plastic! She is still gathering information, and one thing she learned was that Suma Beach is known for being clean and well maintained. The Climate Change Club has a hypothisis that workers at Suma Beach collected trash from nearby cities and/or oceans and made it into a plastic fish as a sign of cleanness or a small peaceful protest.

More information about her trip to Suma Beach below.

At Suma beach, our climate change club member saw absolutely no trash! And, if you can believe it, there is a wildlife conservatory right next to it. Also a public aquarium, this conservatory works hard on learning more and breeding ocean animals.

In Japan, our member noticed some really surprising things. Apparently, the official  etiquette is to wash your trash thoroughly before throwing it away. Also, itâ€™s very important to organize your trash properly! Not what you expected, eh?
